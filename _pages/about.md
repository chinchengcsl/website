I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California under the supervision of  Prof. Justin Haldar. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing high-quality, efficient, and trustworthy image reconstruction algorithms for ill-posed inverse problems in computational imaging. Representative works of mine include a novel image representation that addresses a long-standing computational challenge in non-Cartesian Fourier imaging, as well as a novel framework for designing reconstruction methods that balance quality, efficiency, and transparency.

Prior to Ph.D., I conducted research at National Taiwan University, where I developed machine learning-based autofocus algorithms and image-analysis algorithms for optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep learning.
