My research applies signal processing theory and mathematics to develop rigorous, high-quality, efficient, and  trustworthy image reconstruction algorithms for ill-posed inverse problems in computational imaging. Representative  works of mine include a novel, computationally efficient image representation that addresses a long-standing computational  challenge in non-Cartesian Fourier imaging, as well as a novel framework for designing reconstruction methods that balance  quality, efficiency, and transparency. Many of the algorithms I developed have a broad impact on both classical and modern machine-learning reconstruction methods and are applicable across multiple imaging modalities. 

Before USC, I conducted research at National Taiwan University, where I developed some of the earliest machine learning–based autofocus algorithms, leveraging statistical learning, reinforcement learning, and deep neural networks. I also designed algorithms for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, using methods like robust PCA and deep CNNs.
