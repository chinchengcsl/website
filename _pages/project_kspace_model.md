## Computationally Efficient Image Model for Non-Cartesian Fourier Imaging
In this project, I addressed a long-standing computational challenge (over 25 years) in non-Cartesian Fourier imaging (including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), synthetic aperture radar, and radioastronomy) reconstruction by developing a computationally efficient image representation. A discrete representation of the underlying continuous image is a fundamental component of many methods for non-Cartesian Fourier-imaging reconstruction (whether classical or modern deep-learning methods). For over 25 years, the dominant approach has been the intuitive image-domain voxel-based representation, despite its well-known computational limitations. We conducted theoretical analyses and found that the challenge can be resolved by adopting a novel, theoretically-informed Fourier domain model. This new representation offers significant computational speedups while maintaining—and in some cases, surpassing—image quality compared to the conventional model.
