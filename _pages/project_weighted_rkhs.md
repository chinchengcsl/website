## A Novel Hilbert-Space Reconstruction Framework for Computational Imaging
The modern image reconstruction landscape contains various approaches that achieve different compromises between image quality, speed, and transparency (e.g., deep learning methods are powerful but often black-box; classical methods are transparent but slow). In this project, I addressed the trilemma between quality, speed, and transparency by developing a novel framework for imposing image priors in reconstruction using reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. This formulation enables fast and high-quality regularized reconstruction using single-pass convolutions rather than iterative solvers. It also provides transparency to the reconstruction methods by allowing one to directly inspect the image priors derived from the data.
